# Challenge-Project-Mysterious-Organism
Simulates the creation and mutation of DNA strands for a newly discovered organism, P. aequor. It generates random DNA sequences of 15 bases, allows for mutations, compares DNA between specimens, and checks if a specimen is likely to survive based on its DNA composition. It creates a collection of survivors with DNA suitable for research.
